# Iris-Species-Prediction
This project builds a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—using sepal and petal measurements from the Iris dataset (150 samples, 4 features). A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model is implemented with Python, pandas, and scikit-learn, achieving 96.7% accuracy on the test set.
